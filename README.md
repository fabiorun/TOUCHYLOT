# TOUCHYLOT

TOUCHYLOT is a WPF/C#/Sqlserver application.

I published it on Github as an example of use of the popular WPF Touch Screen Keyboard with some little customizution.

The original purpuose is to let Workers to report manufacturing product difect in the quality process for a glasses industry.

It is implemented with WPF/C#, it is currently installed on Windows XP, Windows 8, Windows 10.

Since it solved my need to have a custom touch keybord integrated into my application that it runs on touch screen monitors, I thought that it may be helpful for someone else and decided to publish it on github. 

Consider that I'm an ASP.NET developer in the need to produce a desktop application, so have marcy for my WPF xaml code :)

Sorry for the Italian comment, revieing to English may be the first "next thing" to do.

#Addition
at some point I found it fancy to add a sidebar ... mobile style, and I integrated https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/MaterialMenu


#Licence
In case you find it useful, just take it and what you want.
Moreover, if you may want to apply some further implementation, don't esitate to contact me, I may also invest some more spear time on it :) 

#ISTALL
to see it working you need to launch the file script_db_creation.sql to create the Database, then into the project (in visual studio) you need to point the connection string to the new database into the app.config file of project TOUCH-LOT 

once you run it, a popup window will appear with a login requesting USer and production lot.

to access it use: 

Operator: 123

LOT:  AS123
